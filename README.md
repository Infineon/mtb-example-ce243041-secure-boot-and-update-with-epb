# PSOC&trade; Control C3 MCU: Secure Boot and update with EPB

This code example demonstrates secure boot and secure firmware update on the PSOC&trade; Control C3M6 MCU using the Edge Protect Bootloader (EPB). Application images are signed and authenticated using either post-quantum cryptography (XMSS_SHA2_10_256, LMS_SHA256_M32_H10, ML-DSA-44/65/87) or classic elliptic-curve cryptography (ECDSA-256, ECDSA-384, ECDSA-521), ensuring integrity and authenticity at boot and during updates. Firmware is downloaded over Infineon's Device Firmware Update (DFU) middleware.

This README is organized around three demonstrations that build on the same base workflow:

1. **Secure boot and update of the application** — Sign the application, configure the EPB to authenticate it, and perform a firmware update over DFU. This is the base flow; the other two demonstrations reuse its steps
2. **Encrypted update** *(optional)* — Additionally encrypt the update image using one of two schemes (EC256 or KDF-CMAC). See the optional note at the end of [Operation](#operation)
3. **Secure boot of the Edge Protect Bootloader** *(optional)* — Sign the EPB and provision the device so the BootROM authenticates the EPB itself before launching it. See the optional note at the end of [Operation](#operation)

> **Note:** Secure boot and update of the application requires **no device provisioning**. Device provisioning — and the [ownership transfer](docs/ownership_transfer.md) that must precede it — is required only for KDF-CMAC encrypted update and for secure boot of the EPB. These two are independent and can be enabled individually.

See the [Design and implementation](docs/design_and_implementation.md) for the functional description of this example.

## Operation

This procedure covers secure boot and update of the application the [encrypted update](docs/setup.md#2-encrypted-update) and [secure boot of the Edge Protect Bootloader](docs/setup.md#3-secure-boot-of-the-edgeprotect-bootloader) demonstrations build on it (see the optional notes at the end of this section).

See [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md) for instructions on creating a project, opening it in various supported IDEs, and performing tasks, such as building, programming, and debugging the application within the respective IDEs.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the J-Link USB connector

2. Open a terminal program and select the J-Link COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud

3. Add the [Edge Protect Bootloader](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce43373-edgeprotect-bootloader) project to your workspace by following the steps in [Using the code example](docs/using_the_code_example.md). When the guide asks you to choose a code example, select the *PSOC Control C3M6 MCU Edge Protect Bootloader* (or, if using the CLI, specify the repository *mtb-example-ce43373-edgeprotect-bootloader*). After the project is created, open it in your preferred supported IDE as described

4. Complete the [secure boot and update setup](docs/setup.md#1-secure-boot-and-update-of-the-application) — generate/import the image signing key and configure the Edge Protect Bootloader to validate application images

5. Build and Program the CE application image and Edge Protect Bootloader image to the device. After programming, the application should start automatically. Confirm "PSOC Control C3M6: Secure Boot and Update with EPB" is displayed on the UART terminal along with the version "Image Version : 1.0.0+0". Also, confirm that the user LED blinks at approximately 1000 ms and has started the DFU transport for receiving an update image

    **Figure 3. Terminal output on program startup**

    ![](images/terminal-startup.png)

6. Build an update image to be transferred to the device to perform the firmware update

    1. Open the file *\<Workspace>/\<app-directory>/Makefile*

    2. Change `IMG_TYPE` to `UPDATE`. This change is required to relocate the application images to the shared slots
        > **Note:** This will automatically change the image version details as shown below
        ```
        IMG_VER_MAJOR=2
        IMG_VER_MINOR=0
        IMG_REVISION=0
        IMG_BUILD_NO=1
        ```

    3. Clean build the project to generate the update image

        > **Note:** Do not program this image using J-Link

7. Download the update image to the device and launch the Edge Protect Bootloader to perform the firmware update

    1. The *mtbdfu* file with the appropriate command sequence to transfer the update image is provided in *\<Workspace>/\<app-directory>/ProgramHex.mtbdfu*. Open the file and update the `dataFile` field in the "commands" section with the absolute path of the project hex file *\<Workspace>/\<app-directory>/build/last_config/mtb-example-ce243041-secure-boot-and-update-with-epb_update.hex*

    2. Ensure you have made the MiniProg4 I2C connection as described in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section, then connect the MiniProg4 to the PC via USB

    3. Download the firmware using either the DFU Host Tool GUI or CLI

        <details><summary><b>Using DFU Host Tool GUI</b></summary>

        1. Open *dfuh-tool.exe* located at *\<install-path>/ModusToolbox/tools_x.y/dfuh-tool*
        2. Select *`<Workspace>/<app-directory>`/ProgramHex.mtbdfu* as the input file to DFU Host Tool
        3. Select the I2C interface
        4. Configure the I2C interface shown in **Figure 4**
        5. Click on *Execute* button to start the image download

            **Figure 4. DFU Host Tool GUI**

            ![](images/dfuht-gui.png)

        </details>

        <details><summary><b>Using DFU Host Tool CLI</b></summary>

        1. Open the modus-shell terminal and move to DFU Host Tool directory (*[install-path]/ModusToolbox/tools_x.y/dfuh-tool*)

        2. Execute the following DFU CLI command from the Host Tool directory in the shell terminal:

            ```
            dfuh-cli.exe --custom-command path-to-mtbdfu-file --hwid Probe-id/COM Port  --interface-params 
            ```

            For example, to use I2C interface, use:

            ```
            dfuh-cli.exe --custom-command `<Workspace>/<app-directory>`/ProgramHex.mtbdfu --hwid MiniProg4-151D0D2303210400 --i2c-speed 400 --i2c-address 53
            ```

            **Figure 5. Console output of DFU Host Tool CLI**

            ![](images/dfuht-cli.png)

        </details>

        > **Note:** See [DFU Host Tool for ModusToolbox&trade; User Guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxDFUHostTool) for more details on each of the interfaces

    4. After successful download of the update image to the device, application triggers a system reset to launch the Edge Protect Bootloader for performing the update

       **Figure 6. Terminal output of image update**

       ![](images/terminal-image-update.png)



8. After firmware update is complete, confirm that the core is running the new image – "PSOC Control C3M6: Secure Boot and Update with EPB" is displayed on the UART terminal along with the version "Image Version : 2.0.0+1". Also confirm that the user LED blinks at approximately 1000 ms and the device has restarted DFU transport for receiving a further update image.

    **Figure 7. Terminal output of updated image**

    ![](images/terminal-updated-image.png)

> **Note (Optional):**  
**Encrypted update:** To deliver the update image as ciphertext, complete the [Encrypted update setup](docs/setup.md#2-encrypted-update) (EC256 or KDF-CMAC), then repeat **steps 6–8** to build and download the update. The combined update hex is now signed **and** encrypted; the bootloader transparently decrypts it while promoting it to the primary slot.  
**Secure boot of the Edge Protect Bootloader):** To make the BootROM authenticate the bootloader itself, complete the [secure boot of the Edge Protect Bootloader setup](docs/setup.md#3-secure-boot-of-the-edgeprotect-bootloader) to sign the bootloader and provision the device, then repeat **steps 5–8**, programming the signed Edge Protect Bootloader in place of the standard one. On each boot, the BootROM authenticates the EPB image before launching it.
